# Evaluate the performance of each model

1) Which model has a lower loss? The RNN Closing Prices Model looks to have a lower loss.
2) Which model tracks the actual values better over time? Again, it looks like the RNN Closing Prices Model is more accurate as well.
3) Which window size works best for the model? I believe a larger window size resulted in better a model, so, the larger the better for this exercise
